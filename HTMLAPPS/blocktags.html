            Oh, to be a cricket,
            That's the thing!
            To scurry in the grass
            And to have one's fling!
            And it's oh, to be a cricket
            In the warm thistle-thicket,
            Where the sun-winds pass,
            Winds a-wing,
            And the bumble-bees hang humming,
            Hum and swing,
            And the honey-drops are coming!
